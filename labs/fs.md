# Lab: file system

In this lab you will add large files and symbolic links to the xv6
file system.

Before writing code, you should read "Chapter 8:
File system" from the [xv6 book](../xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf) and study the corresponding code.

Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the `util` branch:

```
 $ git fetch
 $ git checkout fs
 $ make clean
```

## Large files ([moderate](guidance.md))

In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an xv6
file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks, or 268*BSIZE
bytes (BSIZE is 1024 in xv6). This limit comes from the fact that an
xv6 inode contains 12 "direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect"
block number, which refers to a block that holds up to 256 more block
numbers, for a total of 12+256=268 blocks.

The `bigfile` command creates the longest file it can,
and reports that size:

```
$ bigfile
..
wrote 268 blocks
bigfile: file is too small
$

```
The test fails because `bigfile` expects to be able
to create a file with 65803 blocks, but unmodified xv6 limits
files to 268 blocks.

You'll change the xv6 file system code to support a
"doubly-indirect" block in each inode, containing 256 addresses of
singly-indirect blocks, each of which can contain up to 256 addresses
of data blocks. The result will be that a file will be able to consist
of up to 65803 blocks, or 256*256+256+11 blocks (11 instead of 12, because we will
sacrifice one of the direct block numbers for the double-indirect
block).

### Preliminaries

The `mkfs` program creates the xv6 file system disk image
and determines
how many total blocks the file system has; this size is controlled by
`FSSIZE` in `kernel/param.h`.
You'll see that `FSSIZE` in the repository for
this lab is set to
200,000 blocks. You should see the following output from `mkfs/mkfs`
in the make output:
```
nmeta 70 (boot, super, log blocks 30 inode blocks 13, bitmap blocks 25) blocks 199930 total 200000

```
This line describes the file system that `mkfs/mkfs` built: it
has 70 meta-data blocks (blocks used to describe the file system) and
199,930 data blocks, totaling 200,000 blocks.

If at any point during the lab you find yourself having to rebuild the file system from scratch, you
can run `make clean` which forces make to rebuild fs.img.

### What to Look At

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by `struct dinode`
in `fs.h`. You're particularly interested in `NDIRECT`,
`NINDIRECT`, `MAXFILE`, and the `addrs[]` element
of `struct dinode`. Look at Figure 8.3 in the xv6 text for a
diagram of the standard xv6 inode.

The code that finds a file's data on disk is in `bmap()`
in `fs.c`. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. `bmap()` is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, `bmap()` allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

`bmap()` deals with two kinds of block numbers. The `bn`
argument is a "logical block number" -- a block number within the file,
relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in `ip->addrs[]`, and the
argument to `bread()`, are disk block numbers.
You can view `bmap()` as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

### Your Job

Modify `bmap()` so that it implements a doubly-indirect block,
in addition to direct blocks and a singly-indirect block. You'll have
to have only 11 direct blocks, rather than 12, to make room for your
new doubly-indirect block; you're not allowed to change the size of an
on-disk inode. The first 11 elements of `ip->addrs[]` should
be direct blocks; the 12th should be a singly-indirect block (just
like the current one); the 13th should be your new doubly-indirect
block. You are done with this exercise when `bigfile` writes
65803 blocks and `usertests -q` runs successfully:

```
$ bigfile
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 65803 blocks
done; ok
$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$

```

`bigfile` will take at least a minute and a half to run.

Hints:

- Make sure you understand `bmap()`. Write out a diagram of the
  relationships between `ip->addrs[]`, the indirect block, the
  doubly-indirect block and the singly-indirect blocks it points to, and
  data blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a doubly-indirect
  block increases the maximum file size by 256*256 blocks (really -1,
  since you have to decrease the number of direct blocks by one).

- Think about how you'll index the doubly-indirect block, and
  the indirect blocks it points to, with the logical block
  number.

- If you change the definition of `NDIRECT`, you'll
  probably have to change the declaration of `addrs[]`
  in `struct inode` in `file.h`. Make sure that
  `struct inode` and `struct dinode` have the
  same number of elements in their `addrs[]` arrays.

- If you change the definition of `NDIRECT`, make sure to create a
  new `fs.img`, since `mkfs` uses `NDIRECT` to build the
  file system.

- If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps by crashing,
  delete `fs.img` (do this from Unix, not xv6). `make` will build a
  new clean file system image for you.

- Don't forget to `brelse()` each block that you
  `bread()`.

- You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
   blocks only as needed, like the original `bmap()`.

- Make sure `itrunc` frees all blocks of a file, including
   double-indirect blocks.

- `usertests` takes longer to run than in previous labs
   because for this lab `FSSIZE` is larger and big files are
   larger.


## Symbolic links ([moderate](guidance.md))

In this exercise you will add symbolic links to xv6. Symbolic
links (or soft links) refer to a linked file by pathname; when a
symbolic link is opened, the kernel follows the link to the referred
file. Symbolic links resembles hard links, but hard links are
restricted to pointing to file on the same disk, while symbolic links
can cross disk devices. Although xv6 doesn't support multiple
devices, implementing this system call is a good exercise to
understand how pathname lookup works.

### Your job

You will implement the `symlink(char *target, char *path)`
system call, which creates a new symbolic link at path that refers
to file named by target. For further information, see the man page
symlink. To test, add symlinktest to the Makefile and run it. Your
solution is complete when the tests produce the following output
(including usertests succeeding).

```
$ symlinktest
Start: test symlinks
test symlinks: ok
Start: test concurrent symlinks
test concurrent symlinks: ok
$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$

```

Hints:

- First, create a new system call number for symlink, add an entry
  to user/usys.pl, user/user.h, and implement an empty sys_symlink in kernel/sysfile.c.

- Add a new file type (`T_SYMLINK`) to kernel/stat.h to
  represent a symbolic link.

- Add a new flag to kernel/fcntl.h, (`O_NOFOLLOW`), that can
  be used with the `open` system call. Note that flags passed to
  `open` are combined using a bitwise OR operator, so your new
  flag should not overlap with any existing flags. This will let you
  compile user/symlinktest.c once you add it to the Makefile.

- Implement the `symlink(target, path)` system call to create
  a new symbolic link at path that refers to target. Note that target
  does not need to exist for the system call to succeed. You will need
  to choose somewhere to store the target path of a symbolic link, for
  example, in the inode's data blocks. `symlink` should return an integer
  representing success (0) or failure (-1) similar to `link` and `unlink`.

- Modify the `open` system call to handle the case where the path
  refers to a symbolic link. If the file does not exist, `open`
  must fail. When a process specifies `O_NOFOLLOW` in the flags
  to `open`, `open` should open the symlink (and not
  follow the symbolic link).

- If the linked file is also a symbolic link, you must recursively
  follow it until a non-link file is reached. If the links form a cycle,
  you must return an error code. You may approximate this by returning
  an error code if the depth of links reaches some threshold (e.g., 10).

- Other system calls (e.g., link and unlink) must not
   follow symbolic links; these system calls operate on the symbolic
   link itself.

- You do not have to handle symbolic links to directories for this
  lab.


## Submit the lab

**Time spent**
Create a new file, `time.txt`, and put in a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab.
git add and git commit the file.

**Answers**
If this lab had questions, write up your answers in `answers-*.txt`.
git add and git commit these files.

**Submit**

Assignment submissions are handled by Gradescope.
You will need an SJSU gradescope account.
See Canvas for the entry code to join the class.
Use  [this link](https://help.gradescope.com/article/gi7gm49peg-student-add-course#joining_a_course_using_a_course_code)
if you need more help joining.

When you're ready to submit, run make zipball,
which will generate `lab.zip`.
Upload this zip file to the corresponding Gradescope assignment.

If you run make zipball and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:

```
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in. Continue? [y/N]

```
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked, i.e., not listed in a line that begins with `??`.
You can cause `git` to track a new file that you create using
git add {filename}.

- Please run make grade to ensure that your code passes all of the tests.
The Gradescope autograder will use the same grading program to assign your submission a grade.
- Commit any modified source code before running make zipball.
- You can inspect the status of your submission and download the submitted
code at Gradescope. The Gradescope lab grade is your final lab grade.

## Optional challenge exercises
